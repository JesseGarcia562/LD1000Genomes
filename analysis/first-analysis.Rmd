Attaining 1000 Genome Data and Subsetting Into Genic and Neutral Regions




This repository contains scripts related to the LD empirical analyses of 1000 Genome dataset. 


#Tanya Phung's Work
ALL OF THE BELOW (SCRIPTS AND COMMENTS) IS TANYA PHUNG'S WORK FOUND HERE:
https://github.com/tnphung/1000G_Summary_Stats/

I am attempting to replicate her analysis but instead of just looking at LD of neutral regions of the genome, I plan to look at the LD of selected sites. 


##Subset individuals from 1000G 

These individuals are extracted from 1000 Genomes:

#####YRI: NA18505, NA18517, NA18916, NA18923, NA18877, NA18909, NA18858, NA18865, NA19116, NA19096 

#####CEU: NA06984, NA06985, NA06986, NA06989, NA06994, NA07000, NA07037, NA07051, NA07056, NA07347 

#####CHB: NA18525, NA18526, NA18528, NA18530, NA18531, NA18532, NA18533, NA18534, NA18535, NA18536

To subset the 1000G vcf for each of these populations:

> ./subset_YRI.sh


> ./subset_CEU.sh


> ./subset_CHB.sh

Note that currenly the script is set up to run on UCLA Hoffman HPC

## Extract neutral regions using the program Neutral Region Explorer [Arbiza et al. 2012](http://nre.cb.bscb.cornell.edu/nre/). Output can be found in the directory data/10kb_neutral_regions.

### Filtering criteria:

##### Select Regions to Exclude: 
1. Known genes 
2. Gene bounds 
3. Spliced ESTs
4. Segmental Duplications
5. CNVs
6. Self chain
7. Reduced Repeat Masker

##### Parameters:
1. Miniumum region size: 200bp
2. Recombination rate (cM/Mb): 0.8
3. Genetic map: Decode
4. Human diversity: YRI; Individuals: All; Mask: Strict
5. Min BG selection coefficient: 0.95

**NOTE: when selecting human diversity, one has to choose either CEU, YRI, or CHB. The neutral regions will likely differ depending which population to choose. Therefore, should we have a consensus neutral regions for all three populations?**

The output is a file titled "results_hard.tsv". Found here: 

<b> NOTE: Our copy only outputted results from chromosome 1-9...</b>

> /data/results_Hard.tsv


Splitting the data set by chromosome. 
NRE outputs a whole file with all chromsomes together. Run 

> R split_NRE_Results_Chrom.R


###Process the output after running neutral region explorer program 

From the directory 1000G_Summary_Stats/data/10kb_neutral_regions, do:

>for i in {1..22}; do 
>python ../../scripts/calc_neutralregion_length.py chr${i}_output_from_nre.txt > chr${i}_output_from_nre_clean.txt
>done;

* Output columns are (1) chr, (2) start, (3) end, (4) length, (5) rec, (6) bgs
